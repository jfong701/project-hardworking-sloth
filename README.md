## Technologies
- Node.js: for running our application backend
- Express.js, express-session: handling HTTP requests
- Front end framework: Currently deciding between Vue and React
- Maps API: Currently deciding between Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap+Leaflet
- MongoDB: Storing study spot, user, and location information
- NPM packages for integration between Maps and Frontend

## Top 5 Technical Challenges
- Maps Integration: Learning to use and integrate a map API into our application
- Frontend: Learning to use a front end framework such as Vue or React
- Frontend design for all devices: Creating a Desktop and mobile Friendly, responsive design
- NPM Packages and other libraries: Finding and using packages that may allow easier integration of map components in frontend, and handling location related data requests in backend
